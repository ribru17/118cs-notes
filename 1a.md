# Discussion 1

## Client-server model

- Asymmetric communication model
  - Client requests data:
    - Initiates communication
    - Waits for server response
  - Server (Daemon) responds to requests:
    - Discoverable by clients (e.g. IP address & port)
    - Waits for client connection
    - Processes requests, sends replies
- Clients and servers are programs at the **application layer**

## TCP: Transmission Control Protocol

- A connection is set up between client and server
- Reliable data transfer
  - Guaranteed deliveries of all data
  - No duplicate data will be delivered
- Data will always be received in the order it is sent
- Full-duplex byte stream (in two directions simultaneously)
- Regulated data flow with flow control and congestion control

## UDP: User Data Protocol

- Basic transmission service
  - No connection needed
  - Unit of data transfer: datagram (variable length)
- No reliability guarantee
- No ordered deliver guarantee
- No flow control / congestion control

## Socket APIs

- Socket:
  - An endpoint in inter-process communication across a computer network
  - TCP sockets have tuples of `<ip_addr:port>`
  - On Linux and MacOS, sockets are like files (socket handles are file
    descriptors)
  - TCP sockets provide `write()` and `read()` for sending and receiving data
- Socket port numbers
  - Smaller numbers are reserved and only accessible by super-users

## Caveat: Byte ordering matters

- Data that is sent in little-endian must be read as such, and vice versa
- The API defines methods to convert to proper network ordering
  - This only works for 16- and 32-bit data, more complex data types must be
    taken into account differently
