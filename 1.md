## What is the internet?

- Three components:
  - Hosts (end systems)
  - Communication links
    - Fiber optics cables, radio, etc.
    - **NOTE:** The transition rate is called _bandwidth_
  - Routers and switches
    - **NOTE:** _Packet switching_ means forwarding packets of data
- Network structure:
  - Network edge
    - Internet boundaries, client and server hosts
      - Access networks like home Wi-Fi, DSL, cable network, Ethernet, cellular,
        etc.
  - Network core
    - Internet backbone of interconnected routers

## How are access networks constructed in the first place?

- Signals carried by EM waves (radio) or within wires (Ethernet)
- Network core will move bits around access networks to the destination, using
  routers
- Router functions:
  - Routing: determines source-destination route taken by _data routing
    algorithms_
  - Forwarding: moves data from router's input to appropriate router output

## How can the internet grow so big?

- Connecting all access ISPs to each other does not scale ($O(n^{2})$
  connections)
- Connect all to a global ISP is bad because if the main fails, everything fails
  - Also bad for business as one company will control all traffic
- Connecting to multiple global ISPs reduces work load and is more reliable
- Creating a hierarchical structure is even better as it reduces load and allows
  for regional ISPs

## What is the internet software architecture?

- It is complex:
  - Many difference pieces running in different places
- But simple:
  - All pieces adhere to simple rules
- Rules:
  - Enabling rules
    - Packet switching:
      - Breaking up load into smaller packets
      - Packets are labeled with a number to denote order
